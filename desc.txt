--------------------------------
OOP PHP:

functions inside the class are called methods.
__construct method ==> as soon as we instantiate a new class it runs.

difference between private function and protected function:

        private function only works within the parent class.
        protected function can be still used when the class is extended.

inheritation: when we want a class to inherit all behaviors from a parent class we say:  class Child extends Parent{      }

pow(number,power) will make the first variable to the power of the second variable.
